    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h4>
        As long as I can remember when something didn't work, they called me for help.
        I feel a constant need for knowledge, so I think that programming is perfect for me.
        I started to learn it a year ago. I absolutely love the feeling of professional growth.
        My goal is to become a lead front-end developer and be in charge of the team.
